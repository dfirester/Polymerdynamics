# Polymerdynamics
Numeric approximation to solve tension dynamics along polymeric chain

The following codebank was started from an attempt to solve a partial integro-differential equation describing the tension propegation along a polymer chain, subject to known tension at the boundry (i.e. the two ends of the chain). The code assumes a single linear chain, and solves the tension profile along the chain at a given point in time under predescribed pulling conditions.
